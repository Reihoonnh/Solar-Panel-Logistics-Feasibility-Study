# Solar-Panel-Logistics-Feasibility-Study
Solar Panel Logistics Feasibility Study A MATLAB-based project to assess the logistics cost of deploying solar panels to rural areas, balancing demand and transportation distances.  Supports sustainable energy projects by analyzing cost-effective logistics solutions for rural electrification.
Solar Panel Logistics Feasibility Study
# Project Description
This MATLAB-based project evaluates the logistics cost of deploying solar panels to rural areas, considering demand at multiple sites and the transportation distances from a central warehouse. By balancing energy requirements and delivery distances, this project supports sustainable energy initiatives with a focus on cost-efficient logistics planning for rural electrification.

# Key Objectives
Calculate the total transportation cost for deploying solar panels to multiple rural locations.
Model the energy demand for each site and its respective distance from the warehouse.
Provide a cost-feasibility assessment to aid decision-making for sustainable energy projects.
Use Case
This study can assist:

Renewable energy providers in planning logistics for solar panel installations.
Government agencies and NGOs working on rural electrification projects.
Researchers evaluating cost-effective supply chain models for renewable energy infrastructure.
Project Workflow
The project takes the following approach:

Define the energy demand for each rural location.
Measure the transportation distances (in km) from the central warehouse to each location.
Calculate the total logistics cost using the formula:

Total Cost=Demand×Distance×Cost per km
Output the total cost for deploying solar panels.
Requirements
MATLAB: Ensure MATLAB is installed to run the script.
Code Implementation
# Matlab
% Solar Panel Logistics Feasibility Study

% Input Data

demand = [50, 30, 40]; % Energy demand (kWh) for each rural site

distance = [10, 20, 15]; % Distance (in km) from warehouse to each site

transport_cost_per_km = 5; % Cost per km of transportation in USD

% Total Logistics Cost Calculation

total_cost = sum(demand .* distance * transport_cost_per_km);

% Output the Results

disp('Solar Panel Logistics Feasibility Study');

disp(['Total logistics cost for deploying solar panels: $', num2str(total_cost)]);

# How to Run the Project
Copy the provided code into a MATLAB .m file (e.g., solar_logistics.m).
Open the script in MATLAB.
Run the script.
The total logistics cost will be displayed in the command window.
# Sample Output
Solar Panel Logistics Feasibility Study  
Total logistics cost for deploying solar panels: $8500  

# Potential Extensions
Add more complex cost factors (e.g., fuel costs, vehicle capacity constraints).
Integrate GIS data to simulate real-world locations.
Optimize delivery routes using algorithms like Dijkstra’s or Linear Programming.
